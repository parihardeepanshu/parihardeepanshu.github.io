I am currently pursuing a masters degree in the field of Data Science from Khoury College of Computer and Information and Science, Northeastern University. I did my undergraduation in Electronics and Communication from SRM University ,India. Reading is a hobby of mine and while doing so I came across a story where a supermarket chain was able to increase their revenue by a significant margin by putting two unlikely products Diapers and Beer together for sale. It was found that the fathers of infants tend to buy diapers and beer together and that insight helped them to achieve this new sales record. This story incited in me an interest in data and the infinite insights that we can get just by having the right data. The vast applications that it can provide in various fields like stocks in finance, cancer prediction in healthcare showed me the true power of data. Since then I have been learning in this evergrowing field. Through this website I want to share my journey towards being a Data Scientist.</p></div><div class="skill-lock"></div></section>
