With increasing interest in programming and no coursework regarding it , I bridged the gap through MOOCS and gained experience with Python, MATLAB.
The course also covered important mathematical courses Probability & Random Processes,Discrete Mathematics,Linear Algebra and Statistics. These help me out today as a Machine Learning enthusiast.</P><span class="cd-date">2012-2016</span></div><!-- cd-timeline-content--><!-- cd-timeline-block--></div><div class="cd-timeline-block"><div class="cd-timeline-img cd-movie"><img src="../assets/img/idea14.svg" alt="College"/></div><!-- cd-timeline-img--><div class="cd-timeline-content"><h2>Programmer Analyst at Cognizant Technology Solutions</h2><p>Worked in Technology division on niche technologies.
