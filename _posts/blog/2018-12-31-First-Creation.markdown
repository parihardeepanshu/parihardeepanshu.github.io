My undergraduate curriculum gave me an exposure to the field of electronics and communication but hardware could never hold my interest. My zeal to learn was produced by programming.The interest invoked here pushed me to learn programming on my own through the platform of MOOCS along with my ongoing electronics curriculum. I completed a few courses on python 

1.[Programming for everybody(University of Michigan)][python1]

2.[Interactive Programming in Python(Rice University)][python2]

One on MATLAB

1.[Introduction to Programming with MATLAB(Vanderbilt University)][matlab]

One of the first things I ever made was through this courses. I created the game of ping pong. It was made on the codeskulptor platform created by professor Scott Rixner who was offering the course. 

The game can be played here
